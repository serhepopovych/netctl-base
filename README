Netctl base filesystem layout and install scripts
=================================================

Most of netctl projects depend on specific filesystem layout like
dedicated tmp and logs directory. There is logrotate(8) configuration
file for all these log files.

There is install.sh subsystem for those who want to deploy netctl
projects directly to target system or to run automated tests for it.

Netctl subprojects relying on features described above should add this
project as git-submodule(1).
